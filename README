hexcat
======

An extremely small hexdump tool.

usage
-----
First, clone the repo:

	$ git clone https://codeberg.org/Kaamkiya/hexcat

Then build from source:

	$ cd hexcat
	$ make

If you want to install it system-wide:

	# make install

Help:

	$ ./hexcat -h

If you don't specify a file to read from, hexcat will read from stdin, so you
can also pipe to it:

	$ cat some-file | hexcat

It will write the data to stdout, or you can specify a file using redirection:

	$ echo "Let's go fly a kite" | hexcat > hello.txt

Try `hexcat -h` for all available flags.
