hexcat
======

An extremely small hexdump tool.

usage
-----
First, clone the repo (or just download hexcat.c, it's the only file you really
need.)

	$ git clone https://codeberg.org/Kaamkiya/hexcat

Then build it.

	$ cd hexcat
	$ make

Basic usage:

	$ ./hexcat [path/to/file]

If you don't specify a file to read from, hexcat will read from stdin, so you
can also pipe to it:

	$ cat some-file | hexcat

It will write the data to stdout, or you can specify a file using redirection:

	$ echo "Let's go fly a kite" | hexcat > hello.txt
