Add octal flag
	Rename output flag to -O (most people will probably just redirect output).
	If -o is passed, use printf("%o") for octal formatting instead of %x for
	hexadecimal
---
Add uppercase flag
	If -u is passed, print hexadecimal numbers as uppercase.
---
Windows support
	Checking for a TTY does not work on Windows because <unistd.h> does not exist.
